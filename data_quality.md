What is data quality ?

In simple terms data quality can be defined as
" The degree to which the data meets the requirements of the purpose it was built for "

“As organizations accelerate their digital business efforts, poor data quality is a major contributor to a crisis in information trust and business value, negatively impacting financial performance.”

Ted Friedman, VP Analyst, Gartner

There is another was of describing it " data quality is the absense of defects in data which can not be tolerated"

here we need to accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world and so is the data . It cannot be complete free of defects and it is just fine.
there needs to be a threshold till which we can tolerate defects.


This makes the data quality very subjecive in nature  and its meaning differs for every organization depending on how they intend to use it.

1.Banks and Insurance
2. Media and Advertizing
3. Retail - real time SOH
